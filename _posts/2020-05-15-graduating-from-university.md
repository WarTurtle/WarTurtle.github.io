&nbsp;I've officially graduated! Now I have a degree in Biology (emphasizing in Biological Science) from Utah State University. Along the way, I added minors in Philosophy and Chemistry. I was able to decorate my Diploma with Departmental Honors and an Undergraduate Researcher Designation. 

&nbsp;What am I going to do with this fancy new degree? More education of course! I am currently seeking for a position as a Masters or as a PhD student in Conservation Ecology. I'm interested in using a combination of methods from data science, ecology, and mathematics to understand how human actions are impacting biodiversity.

&nbsp;What else am I going to be doing? ... I'm glad you asked! I am currently volunteering with conservation groups to implement technological solutions to conservation problems. Read more about our project [here.](https://conservationx.com/project/key/trackingpangolinscales)
