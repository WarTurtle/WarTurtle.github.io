I'm excited to announce that I've graduated cum laude from Utah State University with Departmental Honors. Three years ago I started engaging at research at USU, and I immediately had the goal of making an impact with my research. I wasn't content to collect data. I wanted to be involved in the analysis,the discovery and the exloration. After three years of training, I have been able to contribute to a high level mathematical biology investigation. The work that I've performed on this project was used as my Honors capstone project at the University. While I can't yet celebrate my graduation with my friends, at least I have time to spread the word and build up my website! :)
